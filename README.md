# <Java-Quiz>
## Description
Java-Quiz application consits of a set of Java Script questions, these questions have been produced dynamically using Java script.

The questions presented are created based on various click events, the application has time intervals, keeps track of scores achieved whenever the quiz is taken and also writes the score of each test to the local storage.

Since most of the contents are dynamically present, every step needed to have a hide and show functions which was teadious but AI is nothing but a bunch of if statements.

Major learnings were deeper understanding of query selectors, reading, writing and storing to local storage, create and append elements.
